    KINETIC ENERGY </h1>
  </header>

  <p> Spacecraft use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach orbital velocity. In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space.

However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic, then throughout the orbit kinetic and potential energy are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Without loss or gain, however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant. </p>
<p> Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick.
  If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates its speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures). </p>
<p> Flywheels have been developed as a method of energy storage. This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.Several mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula ½mv² given by Newtonian (classical) mechanics is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or sub-atomic scale, quantum mechanical effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.
 The notable types of Kinetic Energy are:<br>

  <li> RADIANT ENERGY
<p> The energy of electromagnetic radiation or light is called radiant energy.
  Radiant energy is also called as electromagnetic energy. This energy can travel through space or medium. As we know that kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Radiant energy is always in motion by travelling through space or medium. Hence, it is a kind of kinetic energy. Generally anything that has temperature gives off radiant energy. The various examples of radiant energy include gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red), infrared radiation, microwaves and radio waves. The energy transmitted to the earth from the sun is also an example of radiant energy. This energy travels at very high speed (299 792 458 m/s) in a straight line.

The light or radiant energy may be visible or invisible to the human eye. Just like other forms of energy, the SI unit of radiant energy is joule. </p> </li>

<li> THERMAL ENERGY
<p> The internal energy of an object due to the motion and collision of atoms and molecules is called thermal energy. Thermal energy is also called as heat energy.

All the matter in the universe is made up of atoms or molecules. This atoms and molecules are always in motion. We can’t see the motion of this energy with our eyes. However, we can feel it when it touches our skin. For example, when you stand outside your house in a sunny, you cannot see the heat from sun. However, you can feel the heat from it.

Thermal energy is produced when the atoms and the molecules move faster and collide with each other. The thermal energy of an object is depends on the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. In the hotter objects the atoms will move or vibrate faster and has high kinetic energy.  Hence, they will produce more thermal energy.

On the other hand, in the colder objects, the atoms have very less kinetic energy. Hence they will produce less thermal energy.  Just like other forms of energy, thermal energy is also measured in joules. </p> </li>

<br><br><br> <li>SOUND ENERGY
<p> Sound energy is a form of energy produced due to vibration of an object. This energy can travel through any medium by transferring energy from one particle to other and can be heard when it reaches a person’s ear.

For example, when an object vibrates it transfers its energy to the surrounding particles and makes them to vibrate. These particles again collide with other particles and so on. Likewise, the sound energy gets transferred from one particle to other.

Sound energy cannot travel through a vacuum because vacuum does not contain any particles to act as a medium. It travels only through a medium such as water, air and solid.

The various examples of sound energy include alarm, vehicles horn, thunder storm, talking with people, drum beating, crackers etc. </p> </li>

<br><br><br> <li> ELECTRICAL ENERGY
<p> The energy of the moving electrons is called electrical energy.  All the objects in the universe are made up of small particles called atoms. Atoms are made up of very small particles like electrons, protons and neutrons. The electrons present in the atom always moves around the nucleus of an atom.

When the external electric field or voltage is applied, the electrons present in the atom gains energy and break the bonding with the parent atom and become a free electron. The energy carried by this free electron is what we called as electrical energy or electricity. </p> </li>
