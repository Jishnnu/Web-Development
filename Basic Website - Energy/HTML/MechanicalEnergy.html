    MECHANICAL ENERGY </h1>
  </header>

  <p> As we already know that, the potential energy is the energy stored in an object because of its position and kinetic energy is the energy of an object that is in motion.

The sum of this potential energy and kinetic energy is called mechanical energy.In other words, it is the energy an object has because of its motion or position or both motion and position. </p>

<p> Every moving object in the universe has the mechanical energy. For example a train moving on the track has mechanical energy. This is due to its motion.
A book placed on a table above the ground at height ‘h’ has mechanical energy (potential energy). This is due to its position above the ground. A satellite revolving around the earth has mechanical energy (both kinetic and potential energy). This is due to its motion (kinetic energy) and its position (potential energy) within the earth’s gravitational field.
A cricket ball thrown in the air has mechanical energy (both kinetic and potential energy). This is due to its motion and its position above the ground.  </p>

<p> Mechanical energy cannot be created or destroyed. However, it can be converted in to another form of energy.

Now-a-days, so many devices are there that converts the mechanical energy into other forms of energy or other forms of energy into mechanical energy. For example, a generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
An electric motor convert’s the electrical energy into mechanical energy.
A steam engine converts the heat energy of a steam (water heated in to the point that turns it into gas) into mechanical energy.
A hydroelectric power plant converts the mechanical energy of water in a storage dam into electrical energy. </p>
