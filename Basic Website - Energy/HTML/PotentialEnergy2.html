  <p> There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force.
For example, the work of an elastic force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the Coulomb force is called electric potential energy; work of the strong nuclear force or weak nuclear force acting on the baryon charge is called nuclear potential energy; work of intermolecular forces is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in fossil fuels, is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of mutual positions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules. Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their mutual positions.

  Forces derivable from a potential are also called conservative forces. Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object's position relative to other objects. Potential energy is often associated with restoring forces such as a spring or the force of gravity. The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential. This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy. If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall.
  The notable types of Potential Energy are: </p>

    <li> <h5>GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY</h5>
  <p> The gravitational energy or gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in the object because of its height above the ground within the gravitational field. We are all experience the force of gravity within the gravitational field of the earth.

If the work is done on the object against the gravitational force, the object will gains gravitational potential energy.
For example, when an object is lifted up to a height ‘h’, work is done against the gravitational force which is pulling it down. This work done on the object is stored as potential energy. If this lifted object is released from height ‘h’ then its potential energy gets converted into the energy of motion or kinetic energy.

The amount of gravitational potential energy an object has depends on mass of the object and height of the object above ground. Objects that are at large height above the ground have more potential energy. Similarly, objects that are at small height above the ground have less potential energy.

Objects that have more mass have more potential energy. Similarly, objects that have less mass have less potential energy. </p> </li>

   <br> <li> <h5>ELASTIC ENERGY</h5>
  <p> Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object that is stretched or compressed. Elastic potential energy can be stored in the elastic objects such as springs, rubber bands etc. Any spring that is stretched or compressed has stored elastic potential energy.

Let us consider a spring that is unstretched as shown in the below figure A. If you apply force on a spring and stretch it (Shown in figure B), then the energy is transferred to spring. The energy that was gained by the spring is called elastic potential energy. The amount of elastic potential energy stored in the spring is equal to the amount of work done or energy applied to stretch the spring. If more amount of force is applied on the spring, then more amount of elastic potential energy is stored in the spring. Similarly, if less amount of force is applied on the spring, then less amount of elastic potential energy is stored in the spring. If the force applied on the spring is removed, then the spring will returns to its original shape. At this point, the amount of elastic potential energy stored in the spring is zero. </p> </li>

  <br> <li> <h5>NUCLEAR ENERGY</h5>
  <p> Nuclear potential energy is the potential energy of the particles such as protons and neutrons that are present inside the nucleus of an atom. This energy holds protons and neutrons together to form nucleus. The nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are bound together by the strong nuclear force.

Large amount of nuclear energy gets released in the form of heat and light when two or more atomic nuclei get combined to form large nucleus or when one nucleus splits in to two smaller nuclei. The process by which two or more nuclei of the atoms get combined to form a large nucleus is called nuclear fusion. This is how sun generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in to helium. The process by which one nucleus split in to two smaller nuclei is called nuclear fission.

Nuclear particles like protons and neutrons are not destroyed in nuclear fusion or fission process but collection of them has less mass than if they were individually free, and this mass difference is liberated as heat and radiation in nuclear reactions.  </p> <br>

<br> <br><li> <h5>CHEMICAL ENERGY</h5>
  <p> Chemical energy is a type of potential energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. The chemical energy gets released often in the form of heat when the bonds between the atoms are broken.
The various examples of chemical energy include batteries, wood, coal, gasoline, photosynthesis etc. <img src="https://img.haikudeck.com/mg/AE903E14-0C49-46CC-ACC2-4E27885CB9DC.jpg" width="468px" style="float: left; margin: 6px; border-radius: 51%;">

<td> The process by which chemical energy gets released or converted in the form of heat energy is called exothermic reaction.

 The candle flame and fire crackers release or convert chemical energy in the form of heat and light.

Burning of wood is also an example of exothermic reaction. The chemical energy stored in the wood gets released in the form of heat energy when we burnt wood. </td>


<td> The process by which heat energy gets observed or converted in the form  of chemical energy is called endothermic reaction.

Photosynthesis is an example of endothermic reaction; Photosynthesis is the process by which plants converts’ solar energy in to chemical energy. Plants use the energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water in to glucose and oxygen.

Evaporation of water is also an example of endothermic reaction. Evaporation of water takes place due to absorption of heat energy.

<li> <h5>ELECTRIC ENERGY</h5>
  <p> Electric potential energy is the potential or stored energy that charged particles have because of its own electric charge and its relative position to other charged particles. Electric potential energy is also called as electrostatic potential energy. As we know that there is a gravitational field around the earth. Any object placed within the gravitational field of the earth will experience a force towards the earth.
In the similar way there exists an electric field around a charged particle. Any charged particle that is placed in the electric field of other charged particle will experience a force. This force may be repulsive or attractive. The SI unit of electric potential energy or electrostatic potential energy is joule.
