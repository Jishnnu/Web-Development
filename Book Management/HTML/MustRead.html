  </header>
  <p>There’s no question that reading is important — it educates, inspires, entertains, and so much more. But with
    thousands of books published every week, how does a reader (especially one that is just getting into reading) decide
    which one to pick up? This question often occurs for me because I am a reader myself! But I won't read any other
    book until i read all these...
