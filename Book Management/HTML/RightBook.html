      <h5 style="color:#041066;"> READ WHAT YOU LIKE: </h5>
      The first rule in Choosing Books Club is to read what you like! This may seem like odd advice to begin with
      because, well, isn’t it obvious? In fact, no.
      <img
        src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/588142e346c3c4aa61c1c2ee/58e1340bbb7f1e086cf85e1d/58e1340cbb7f1e086cf85e38/1491153932348/woman-reading-a-book-014.jpg?format=original"

      Far too many people allow their reading to be guided by the taste of others; they limit themselves to bestseller
      lists or the latest publishing craze or want only to read the “right” books. How many people’s love of reading has
      been thwarted by attempts to cram themselves with so-called classics or opaque literary tomes? As if literary
      fiction or classics <br> (if there is even a proper definition for these terms) are the pinnacle of reading taste.
      Actually, neither classics nor literary fiction are categories that are helpful in classifying ones reading
      tastes.To wit, how different are classics like Death Comes for the Archbishop by Willa Cather or Sherwood
      Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio from The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton? The three novels were written by American
      authors within ten years of each other (1927, 1919, 1920, respectively), and yet the qualities that draw readers
      to them differ wildly!
      With so many choices out there, every reader can find a book to match their preferences. Yet, this abundance of
      opportunity can also be too much of a good thing. How does a willing reader sift through the stacks to find the
      book that is right for them? Have no fear, there are ways.

      <h5 style="color:#041066;"> DISCOVERING YOUR READING TASTES: </h5>
      Do you enjoy stories that fling you forward at a breakneck pace or do you prefer they let you amble along smelling
      the flowers? Are you fan of dark humor or
      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/e2/1a/f3e21a2efd51bc512fc79905e585266c.jpg" height="480px"
        style="float:right; margin: 12px;">
      slapstick comedy? Do you want a book that gets you all hot and bothered or one that makes you too terrified to
      remain home alone? Is your favorite story told in ornate, baroque, extravagant poetry, or hard-boiled, staccato,
      prosaic prose?

      All of these questions are directly related to isolating the “appeals” you are drawn to. Thinking about your
      favorite stories (books, movies, plays, doesn’t matter) through these terms allows you to get a sense of your
      preferences. It gives you a language to articulate your tastes. Whether you are looking for a novel or narrative
      non-fiction, you can now begin mapping the sorts of stories you most appreciate on the gamut of options out in the
      world!
      I mentioned appeals in a previous article when I talked about Readers’ Advisory, a subfield of library science
      devoted to book recommendation. There, I mentioned Joyce G. Saricks, who in her book Readers Advisory in the
      Public Library, isolates five facets of appeals:
      <br>
      <br>Pacing: How quickly does the book move? Is it a page-turner or will it, like War and Peace did for me, take a
      month to finish?
      <br><br>Characterization: How are the characters treated by the author? Are they described so deeply that the book
      could be called a character study?
      <br><br>Frame and Tone: What is the mood of the book? Is it heartwarming? Thrilling? Dark? Philosophical? Quirky?
      <br><br>Story line: What is the orientation of the plot? Is it character-driven or action-oriented? Very complex?
      Inspirational? Absurd?
      <br><br>Style: How could the author’s writing style be described? Spare? Conversational? Poetic? Intricate? Are
      they archetypal chess pieces in a complicated game?
    </li>

      <h5 style="color:#041066;">FINDING YOUR GENRE: </h5>
      One way of narrowing your reading options is by considering which genres encapsulate your favorite appeals. Most
      people have a fairly robust
      <img src="https://justpublishingadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Do-You-Know-Your-Book-Genre.png"
        height="360px" style="float:left; margin: 12px;">
      understanding of well-known genres. We know, for example, that mysteries tend to be fast-paced and thrilling,
      they’re often written without adornment, though individual authors sometimes have recognizable styles.
      Alternately, the fantasy genre is filled with dense characterization, globs of description, and proceeds at a
      stately pace.

      Though there are exceptions (many of which would fit into sub-genres), a genre serves as a sort-of calling card
      when it comes to appeals. Genre conventions offer an easy way for readers to find their tribe; for me, most
      science fiction offers the ideal balance of plot (heavy), description (light), characterization (medium), with
      styles that range from <br> off-kilter/humorous (Connie Willis, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams) to plain weird
      (Philip Dick, Cory Doctorow esp. with Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town, and Theodore Sturgeon w/ More
      Than Human), to fairly straightforward (most Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, James White). But it’s different for
      everyone.

      Take a look at this list of genres and the appeals you associate with them. Choose one that tickles your fancy and
      let’s get you moving!

      <h5 style="color:#041066;"> NARROWING YOUR OPTIONS: </h5>
      So you understand your appeals and genre preferences, now you can get down to business: The hundreds, even
      thousands, of options readily available in each genre!

        style="float:right; margin: 12px;">
      What to do?
      Here are some tips that can help:<br>

      Read books by their covers! It’s fine, librarians do it all the time. Go to a bookstore, library, or your favorite
      online shop and browse. Does a book’s cover art appeal to you? Perfect, now read the inside flap, what do you
      think of the plot description? If you like it, you’ve found your book!
      Many libraries offer free access to a website called NoveList, a Readers’ Advisory librarian’s secret weapon!
      NoveList is database of expert recommendations which include lists of “read-alikes” (books that read like other
      books!) based on all sorts of appeals. My favorite thing about NoveList is their read-alike essays — short,
      insightful articles written by genre experts explaining an author’s (or a books) appeals and recommending others
      with similar appeals.
      Another online resource I find useful is Goodreads recommendations. Generally, I find automated recommendations
      lame (I’m looking at Amazon here), but Goodreads does a surprisingly fine job of serving interesting books based
      on specific shelves in one’s account. (Yes, I know Amazon owns Goodreads.)
      Though I’ve steered you away from the other’s opinions, now that you’re comfortable with your tastes, go check out
      popular awards for your genre, book blogs, and websites dedicated to the type of books you like.
      Finally, go ask a librarian! Not all librarians are good at Readers’ Advisory, but there’s usually at least one in
      every building that relishes talking about books of all sorts. Tell them what you’d like and let them do their
      job. Hopefully, you’ll end up with a few choices you’ll enjoy!
      Parting Words
      Reading is a wonderful journey full of enormous variety! Try things out! Once you’ve settled into your reading
      groove, select something totally different for a change and a challenge. I used to be a “finisher,” I had to
      finish every book I picked up. But as I’ve aged, I’ve changed. Who has time to waste reading dreadful books? Now,
      when I pick one up, I’ll read the first 50 or 100 pages <br> (1–2 hours if we’re talking audiobooks) and if I’m
      not digging it, I move on. Betty Rosenberg’s quote echoes in my mind as I close the book and, unapologetically,
      select something better suited to my reading tastes. I prefer to enjoy my reading, and you should too!
